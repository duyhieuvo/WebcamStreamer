This short program utilized the Webcam Capture API by Sarxos (https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture) to capture, interpret and display the video stream from the webcam.
The video streaming function has been re-implemented based on the existing file 'WebcamStreamer' in the API. 
The ability of changing the resolution while streaming is added in this program. A button to switch on/off the streaming function has been also included in the GUI.
